Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data (Sustainable Future Through Renewable Energy)

Data formatted in MS Excel. Prepared histograms in Tableau by focusing on the largest CO2 emission countries. Used these visual diagrams in the final presentation.Findings of the project: From 1991 to 2018, China's CO2 emission has increased dramatically, 74% due to the increase of the production lines, mostly consumable products. While China CO2 emissions have increased by 74%, US emissions have increased by 5%. And Globally, Total CO2 emission increased % by 30.
