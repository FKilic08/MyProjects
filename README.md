Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data (CME 591: Sustainable Future Through Renewable Energy)

Data has been formatted in MS Excel. Prepared histograms in Tableau by focusing on the largest CO2 emission countries such as China, India, the US, etc. Used these visual diagrams in the final presentation of the course. 

Findings of the project: From 1991 to 2018, China CO2 emission has been increased dramatically, 74% due to the increase of the production lines, moslty consumable products. 
While China CO2 emission has been increased 74%, US emission has been increased 5%. 
And Globally, Total CO2 emission has been increased %30.
